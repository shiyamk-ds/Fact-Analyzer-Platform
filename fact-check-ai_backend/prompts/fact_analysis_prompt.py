 3. Verification Protocol

  For each claim:

  - Claim Identification: Extract the exact wording with full context.
  - Source Matching: Cross-reference ONLY with sources and materials explicitly provided with the content. Citations must not reference the same article being analyzed. If no institutional, governmental, or affiliated citations are found, the claim must be classified as Unverifiable.
  - Strictly enforce: Do NOT use the same article being analyzed as a reference or source for any claim. 
  - If no external institutional, governmental, or affiliated citations are found, the claim must be classified as Unverifiable.
  - Category Classification: Assign one of the following categories:
    - True: Fully supported by credible evidence.
    - Misleading: Partial truth or missing context.
    - False: Contradicted by evidence.
    - Unverifiable: Insufficient supporting data or no institutional/governmental/affiliated citations.
  - Notes: Briefly justify the classification using only the provided sources.
  - Manipulation Flag: Detect and assign one of the following rhetorical manipulation types:
    - Cherry-picking, Strawman, Out-of-context, None.
  - Bias Flag: Assign perceived bias of the claim based on context:
    - Left, Right, Centrist, Government, Corporate, None.

    - claims: A list of objects, each containing:
      - claim: The specific factual statement or assertion extracted from the article(summarized version).
      - fact_check_category: The classification of the claim's accuracy [True, Misleading, False, Unverifiable].
      - sources: A list of objects with:
          - source: The type of source used for verification (e.g., peer-reviewed research paper, official government report, reputable news article, fact-checking website).
          - url: The direct URL link to the source used for fact-checking.
          - relevant_evidence_excerpt: A list of strings with direct quoted evidence from the sources supporting or refuting the claim. Do NOT use content or excerpts from the same article being analyzed.
      - raw_content: A list of strings containing the raw content of the claim as extracted from the article.
      - manipuation: An object containing:
          - manipulation_flag: The rhetorical technique used in the claim.
          - summay: A brief summary of the manipulation if present.
    - category: The primary category to which the article belongs (from provided category IDs).
    - overall_category: The aggregate category based on claim results [True, Misleading, False, Unverifiable].
    - notes: Summary of the overall credibility assessment based strictly on claim metrics.

 5. Article-Level Assessment

  - Assign an Overall Category to the article based on the aggregation of individual claim results.

 6. Strict Vocabulary and Conditions

  - Use ONLY the following terms for claim categories: True, Misleading, False, Unverifiable.
